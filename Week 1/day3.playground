// 1. Arithmetic Operators
let first = 12
let second = 4

let sum = first + second
let difference = first - second
let product = first * second
let division = first / second
let remainder = 13 % second

let number = 35
let isMultiple = number.isMultiple(of: 7)

// 2. Operator overloading
let fakers = "fakers gonna "
let action = "fake"
let chorus = fakers + action

let firstHalf = ["Aries", "Taurus"]
let secondHalf = ["Gemini", "Cancer"]
let firstFour = firstHalf + secondHalf

// 3. Compound assignment operators
var score = 95
score -= 5

var quote = "Alex is so "
quote += "awesome"

// 4. Comparison operators
var comparingOne = 5
var comparingTwo = 8
print (comparingOne == comparingTwo)
print (comparingOne != comparingTwo)
print (comparingOne < comparingTwo)

// 5. Conditions
let firstCard = 11
let secondCard = 10

if firstCard + secondCard == 21{
    print("BlackJack")
} else {
    print ("Regular Cards")
}

// 6. Combining Conditions
var Alex = 21
var Layla = 20

if (Alex > 21 && Layla > 21){
    print ("Both are over 21")
} else if (Alex > 18 || Layla > 18){
    print ("At least one is over 18")
}

// 7. The ternary operator
let terFirst = 20
let terSecond = 10

print(terFirst == terSecond ? "They are the same" : "They are different")
print (terFirst >= terSecond ? "It's greater" : "It's not")

// 8. Switch statements
let weather = "sunny"
switch weather {
case "rainy":
    print("Bring an umbrella")
case "snowy":
    print("Get a coat")
case "sunny":
    print("Wear sunscreen")
default:
    print("Enjoy")
}

// 9. Range operators
let grade = 85
switch grade {
case ..<50:
    print ("You failed badly")
case ..<85: // ...85
    print ("Kinda ok")
default:
    print("You did great")
}

let names = ["Abi", "Alex", "Raul", "Rodri"]
print (names[1...3])
print (names[1...])
